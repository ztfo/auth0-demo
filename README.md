# auth0-demo
A personal project to explore how to implement Auth0 using C# and .NET 6

## Description

This is a web application that uses Auth0 for authentication and authorization. Users can log in and log out. The application supports OpenID Connect and Cookie Authentication.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can log in using their Auth0 credentials.
- Auth0 Integration: The application is integrated with Auth0 for handling user authentication.
- Logout: Users can log out, which clears their session from the application and Auth0.

## Up Next

- Connect Auth0 to a custom database for storing user data.
- Implement user registration flow.
- Add support for admin, user, and guest roles.
- Enable email verification and Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).
- Improve post-registration actions, such as redirecting to a dashboard and displaying a welcome message.

## Live Application

The application is deployed to Azure and can be accessed at http://demo-bww.azurewebsites.net/.
